# Assignment 1: HTML/CSS CodePen

## Due date

All due dates can be found [here](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/stuff-you-need-to-know/important-dates.md).

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to practice converting some (not all!) sections of a provided design into functional, responsive website elements. We will not be building a whole site, so for this assignment we will be using [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).

## Description

This assignment is meant to emulate a common task you will perform as a front-end developer - mocking up pieces of a provided website design. This is often done for practice, to check functionality, and to demonstrate or assess the feasibility of the designer's vision. It is important to make sure design elements can be converted into a good experience for users regardless of the device on which they are viewing the site, so these elements aren't just quick sketches; they should be fully responsive and realized sections of a website.

### Working with a design

Take the time to fully understand the design. It will help you know how to approach your code, with lots of information about measurements, font sizes, and colours.

Remember that you can discuss font sizes with the designer if you think they are too small to be read comfortably!

## Requirements

### Designs

Much like in the workplace, you don't get to choose the design you code - you'll be assigned! You can find your design assignment in [the groups doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lU6N_JFdUwuuobWR3n1Z7TQEppbupLlOHIozshogQ3I/edit#gid=1160457329) - **check the 'Assignment 1 (PSD) Groups' tab**. Headings of the columns are links to the zip files.

From your respective design, you will be expected to build **the header section, and at least one other section of your choosing**.

Follow this [design checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17GYf0CfvD8Mdt4fXXH_03Hc-L-y9V3xLSbO5AIfdK54/edit) to help perfect your conversion!

#### Design assets

- [Hangry Tummy](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/raw/master/projects/assignment-01/hangry-tummy.zip)
- [Tasty](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/Tasty.zip)

Note that it isn't possible to host site assets directly on CodePen, so we have hosted them for you here:  
[Assignment 1 hosted assets](https://psd.hackeryou.com/assignment1-assets/)  
You can use absolute links to any assets you need, and improtantly **you must link to the assets with `https` for them to work**.

### Code

This assignment will be marked as a simple completed/not completed. However, you should ensure you are giving attention to:

- All site sections you build are responsive and use media queries
- Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
- Semantic HTML elements are used properly
- Setup snippet is used
- All images considered content have descriptive alt text
- Naming convention throughout HTML and CSS is consistent
- Assignment represents the provided design well

As well as the items listed above, be sure to consider the best practices found in [this lesson](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/stuff-you-need-to-know/resources-and-cheat-sheets/philosophy-of-best-practices-for-html-and-css.md).

### Presentation

There will be no presentations for this assignment.

## Working in CodePen

This assignment is being built in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), a common industry tool for quick mockups and code-sharing. It is a useful tool to be familiar with, both professionally and for your own convenience. CodePen is great! They did not pay us for this advertising but if anyone from CodePen is interested in setting up a lucrative sponsorship deal, please get in touch with the Juno instructors and don't tell Brent I added this to the notes.

A few notes on using CodePen:

- As it is meant to be a quick and easy code sandbox, no boilerplate code is needed when writing markup in CodePen. That means you don't need to worry about `html`, `body` or `head` elements. Nice!
- Make sure you're signed up and logged in! Then all code you write in your pen will always be saved as you go.
- Use the pen's settings to do all kinds of useful stuff:
  - Add external stylesheets or font scripts.
  - Set your pen to automatically add in a normalize / setup snippet.
  - Go to settings -> editor and select 'your global editor settings' to set up your preferences to match VSCode; a big one: **you can use emmet in CodePen!**
- As mentioned above, it is impossible to host assets in CodePen itself, so use [the assets we hosted for you here](https://psd.hackeryou.com/assignment1-assets/) with absolute links **starting with `https`**.

## Submitting your assignment

1. Rename the your CodePen to `firstname-lastname-assignment-one`.
2. Submit your CodePen URL using the submission form for your cohort below:

- [Spring 1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4WcGHI9lIs9h4p-WOAxaEZ9_XGVu6auOlnKUnCno7nx0EAg/viewform)

## Lateness

Late submission is considered as not completed.

## No plagiarism!! ðŸ‘€ We'll be watching for it!

Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your assignment walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your assignment**.
